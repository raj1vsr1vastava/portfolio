# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix - Step by Step Guide

## Step 1: Check Your Site
Visit https://raj1vsr1vastava.github.io/portfolio/ in a private/incognito browser window to see if the updated deployment fixed the issue.

## Step 2: If Still Blank, Check Browser Console
1. Visit your site in Chrome
2. Press F12 or right-click and select "Inspect"
3. Go to the "Console" tab
4. Look for any error messages related to script loading, CORS, or other issues

## Step 3: Clear GitHub Pages Cache
GitHub Pages sometimes caches content. You can force a refresh by:
1. Going to your GitHub repository
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Change the branch setting to "None" and save
4. Change it back to "gh-pages" and save

## Step 4: Direct Asset Check
Try accessing your JavaScript file directly:
https://raj1vsr1vastava.github.io/portfolio/static/js/main.57623b33.js

If this returns a 404 error, there's an issue with how files are being deployed.

## Step 5: Check Repository Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click Settings → Pages
3. Verify:
   - Source is set to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch is "gh-pages" / "(root)"
   - Custom domain is empty (unless you have a custom domain)

## Step 6: Manual Fix
If all else fails, try this manual approach:
1. Run: `npm run build`
2. Add these files to the build directory:
   - `.nojekyll` (empty file)
   - A modified `index.html` with debugging info
3. Deploy with: `npx gh-pages -d build -t true`

## Step 7: Test with Simple HTML
You can check if your test.html page works:
https://raj1vsr1vastava.github.io/portfolio/test.html

If this works but the main page doesn't, the issue is with your React application's configuration.

## Step 8: Consider Custom 404 Page
Create a `404.html` in your build folder that redirects to index.html. This can help with routing issues.

## If All Else Fails
Consider rebuilding your project with:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-portfolio --template typescript
```

And then migrating your components and content to the new project structure.
